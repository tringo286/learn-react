## Styling Methods and Their Use Cases

### 1. External CSS
 
- Best for projects with global, shared styles.  
- Ideal for small or medium-sized applications where class names don't conflict.

### 2. CSS Modules
 
- Perfect for large-scale projects where style conflicts need to be avoided. 
- Suitable for collaborative teams working on different parts of a project.

### 3. Inline Styling
 
- Useful for small, simple components where minimal styles are required.
- Works well for prototyping.
