# Lesson 18: Context API

This lesson covers using the **React Context API** to manage global state and avoid prop drilling in React applications.

---

## Features

- **`DataContext`** (`context/DataContext.jsx`): Provides global state, and wraps the app to make the context available throughout.

### Benefits

- **Global State**: Share state across components without prop drilling.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Context allows real-time updates across components that consume it.
